# Sprint 3 (12/04-12/15)

## Forecast

We forecasted that we could get **12 story points** done during this sprint. Using Yesterday's Weather Forecasting Pattern, we forecasted 20% higher value than what we accomplished in sprint 2 (10 points) as we factored in improved productivity resulting in higher velocity. 

The forecast correlates to the next four stories from our [Initial Ordered Product Backlog](https://trello.com/b/qb2G2V5r/product-back-log).



| __Number__ | __Title__ | __Story Points__ | __User Stories__
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | 'Static Tagging for Category Assignment' Blog/Content Feature| 2 pts | As a site administrator, Andy can use tags and associate it with each blog post so users can eventually filter results based on tags. Here is an initial tag list  "Real World Application", "Class of Neural Network", "Chat Bots", Speech Recognition", "Machine Learning", "Class of Artificial Intelligence". |
| 2. | 'Upvoting/Downvoting for blogs' Blog Feature | 3 pts | As a site user, Andy wants users to be able up-vote and down-vote blog posts so that the community can filter the best content to the top.  |
| 3. | 'Examples Pages' content page| 5 pts | As a site user, Andy wants to be able to view a layout of Neural Network Examples that represent each unique class of AI models that currently has as its counterpart a production ready Real-World Application.  |
| 4. | 'Search for site content' site feature | 2 pts | As a site user, Andy can search for content (examples or blogs) from the home page or examples or blogs page. Andy can use tags associated with each blog posts and solution page to search for, filter results based on "Real World Application", "Class of Neural Network", topic, industry, etc., making it easier to find the content he is looking for. |


## Kanban Board

We are continuing to use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/qb2G2V5r/product-back-log) as our Kanban Board and screenshot provided below:

## Collaboration
Our Team met as a group at least 2x per week to synchronize and elevate obstacles along our critical path; additionally, individuals teamed up to pair program in order to solve various engineering tasks.

### Behavior-Driven Development & Unit Tests

We continued to use the [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) framework and  [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to run our Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests. Specifically we tested upvoting and downvoting for a blog  using BDD. See the screenshots below (showing test failed and then passed). 

![BDD Fail Screen](https://github.com/BrainCradle/CSCIE-71-Project/blob/master/sprint3/BDD-fail.png)

 BDD source code is checked here: https://github.com/BrainCradle/BrainCradle/tree/master/BDD
   
Our TDD and unit tests (we have used tool called Karma) are shown below including a failed one and passed ones.

## Sprint Review and Retrospective

We conducted our sprint review with stakeholders and Scrum Team retrospective on NOV 19TH. 

### Sprint Review Stakeholder Feeback

We reviewed the sprint 3 user stories in production (https://braincradleai.firebaseapp.com/#/) with our product owner Devon Luongowho is an AI enthusiast and a student at Harvard Extension School. He is pleased with the progress of our efforts. He offered the following feedback on the upvoting/downvoting and site search functionality, mostly looking towards the next sprint:

- The blog creation widget is clean, simple, and flexible. It allows those who know HTML to create more robust post designs by leveraging the bootstrap environment, while not overloading non-technical people. 
- The ability to search for content by use case is awesome. 
- The rigid tagging will help to maintain organization. I like that I can enter tags by typing into a textbox (that also functions like a drop down menu). 
- I should be able to see the upvote/downvote values even when not signed in. CUrrently it is visible only when I am logged in.
- As content expands, it would be nice to search by topic or keyword and find all related content
- I'd like for "add" button to be disabled for the examples section. This should be a place where only site admins associated with Brain Cradle can add content. The blogs sections is the designated open forum. 

This feedback will be absorbed into the product backlog (and groomed) ahead of sprint 4 planning.
 
### Scrum Team Retrospective

While the retrospective is a generally closed door event, we chose to share these highlights:

- There was confusion on Sprint 2 feedback/grades from Richard particularly on unit tests. Clarifying it on slack and video conference with Richard helped provide feedback on how to improve in Sprint 3
- Team has now gone into performing mode and we can significantly improve our velocity in future sprints.
- The whole team benefitted from this experience and feels confidence on championing agile projects in their respective workplaces

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
We also solidified our CI/CD process in this sprint (started in sprint1).
![CI process](https://github.com/BrainCradle/CSCIE-71-Project/blob/master/Sprint%202/CI-CD.png)

Travis CI is a continuous integration platform we are using with your Github projects. Using Travis we have Build Pushes and Build Pull Requests turned ON. This means that anytime we push our changes to our Github repository or merge a pull-request, Travis CI will trigger a build and runs  tests every time we push to our branch (or merge a pull request) - see image below. Once the build succeeds it triggers a script to deploy the build to Firebase in production.
