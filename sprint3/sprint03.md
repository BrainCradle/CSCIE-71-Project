# Sprint 3 (12/04-12/15)

## Forecast

We forecasted that we could get **12 story points** done during this sprint. Using Yesterday's Weather Forecasting Pattern, we forecasted 20% higher value than what we accomplished in sprint 2 (10 points) as we factored in improved productivity resulting in higher velocity. 

The forecast correlates to the next four stories from our [Initial Ordered Product Backlog](https://trello.com/b/qb2G2V5r/product-back-log).



| __Number__ | __Title__ | __Story Points__ | __Summary__
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | 'Static Tagging for Category Assignment' Blog/Content Feature| 2 pts | As a site administrator, Andy can use tags and associate it with each blog post so users can eventually filter results based on tags. Here is an initial tag list  "Real World Application", "Class of Neural Network", "Chat Bots", Speech Recognition", "Machine Learning", "Class of Artificial Intelligence". |
| 2. | 'Upvoting/Downvoting for blogs' Blog Feature | 3 pts | As a site user, Andy wants users to be able up-vote and down-vote blog posts so that the community can filter the best content to the top.  |
| 3. | 'Examples Pages' content page| 5 pts | As a site user, Andy wants to be able to view a layout of Neural Network Examples that represent each unique class of AI models that currently has as its counterpart a production ready Real-World Application.  |
| 4. | 'Search for site content' site feature | 2 pts | As a site user, Andy can search for content (examples or blogs) from the home page or examples or blogs page. Andy can use tags associated with each blog posts and solution page to search for, filter results based on "Real World Application", "Class of Neural Network", topic, industry, etc., making it easier to find the content he is looking for. |


## Kanban Board

We are continuing to use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/qb2G2V5r/product-back-log) as our Kanban Board and screenshot provided below:

## Burndown

Our burndown chart, shown below, is based on the completion of each user story [Refer to Trello for Stories "Done in Sprint 3"](https://trello.com/b/qb2G2V5r/product-back-log) which were decomposed from the PBIs committed to the sprint.

## Collaboration
Our Team met as a group at least 2x per week to synchronize and elevate obstacles along our critical path; additionally, individuals teamed up to pair program in order to solve various engineering tasks.

### Behavior-Driven Development & Unit Tests

We continued to use the [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) framework and  [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to run our Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests. Specifically we tested user login for blog view using BDD. See the screenshots below (showing test failed and then passed).

## Sprint Review and Retrospective

We conducted our sprint review with stakeholders and Scrum Team retrospective on NOV 19TH. 

### Sprint Review Stakeholder Feeback

We reviewed the sprint 2 user story in production [User Comments for Blogs](https://braincradleai.firebaseapp.com/#/blogs) with an AI student stakeholder, Hazem Salama, who is a software engineer with Verizon Communications and a student at Harvard Extension School. Hazem is pleased with the progress of our efforts. He offered the following feedback on the blog functionality, mostly looking towards the next sprint:

- I like the simple design of the blog and it looks very pleasing
- The navigation is easy and not complicated
- I cannot vote up blog entries
- When I try to enter a comment but decide to cancel, the cancel button does not function as expected
- Tab order is not working as expected
- When I expand a blog entry to read the full blog and press the back button then it takes me back to previous page. Its slightly confusing

This feedback will be absorbed into the product backlog (and groomed) ahead of sprint 3 planning.
 
### Scrum Team Retrospective

While the retrospective is a generally closed door event, we chose to share these highlights:

- Finalzing right CI/CD framework took time as there were many choices. Narrowing focus to couple of frameworks and quick PoCs helped finalize the right tool.
- There was confusion on Sprint 1 feedback/grades from Richard. Clarifying it on slack channel helped provide feedback on how to improve in Sprint 2
- Not having product owner available during holidays hampered our ability to complete couple of stories as we needed clarification on the story. We then came to an agreement with product owner that we would deliver only 4 stories since the sprint window was too short post clarification. To mitigate this we have now obtained emergency contact details of the entire team in case we need to reach anybody on emergency basis.

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
We also solidified our CI/CD process in this sprint (started in sprint1).
![CI process](https://github.com/BrainCradle/CSCIE-71-Project/blob/master/Sprint%202/CI-CD.png)

Travis CI is a continuous integration platform we are using with your Github projects. Using Travis we have Build Pushes and Build Pull Requests turned ON. This means that anytime we push our changes to our Github repository or merge a pull-request, Travis CI will trigger a build and runs  tests every time we push to our branch (or merge a pull request) - see image below. Once the build succeeds it triggers a script to deploy the build to Firebase in production.
