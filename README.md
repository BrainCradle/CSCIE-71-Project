Relative Size Estimating Activity:
We estimated using the relative sizing story point estimation range from 1 to 21 (Planning poker range). Each estimator is holding a deck of Planning Poker cards with values like 1,2,3,5,8,13, and 21 - These were the defaults of Trello. 
Members involved in estimation (Development team only)
- Ailing
- Digant
- Shivas

Forecast for story points: 5 for sprint 1.

Rationale for forecast: Given this is our first time working as a team, we provided a conservative forecast based on different skill mix and collective estimate of throughpput we think we can achieve in this sprint.
