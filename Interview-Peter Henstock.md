### Interview Script - Peter Henstock

1. What is the single biggest problem facing the AI Research Community? What’s getting in the way of the field progressing forward?

Response: In my area it is data organization and making it ready for AI. We have also a lack of understanding of what AI can and cannot do which is holding it back. 

2. If you could wish a product into existence, what product would you bestow upon the AI Research field to push the field in the right direction?

Response: Magical visualization that could take any data and create perfect plots to yield an understanding of the data or result. 

3. Are there any tools for people that want to create Neural Nets, but don’t know how to code? If yes, what are they?

Response: TensorFlow and Keras are getting pretty close to this with the high level scripts and standard networks.  A wrapper is the next step. 

4. Our goal is to “Further AI for the Common Good”, where would you suggest we focus our efforts? Where can we make this biggest impact? What does the space need the most?

Response: The medical field has thousands of data-dependent problems that can advance healthcare.
